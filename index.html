				 FOOTBALL	
			</div>
		<p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees,
		   kicking a ball to score a goal. The ball is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference
		   and known as the football. The two teams each compete to get the ball into the other
		   team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal.The team
		   that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have
		   scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a 
		   captain whose responsibility is  to represent their team in the coin toss.
